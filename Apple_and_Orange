# I would present you with two different solutions one with the traditional way and one with the list comprehension way.

# Traditional:

def countApplesAndOranges(s, t, a, b, apples, oranges):
    count_Apple = 0
    count_Oranges = 0
    # go through the list and take every element and apply the below if statement
    for apple in apples:
        # Is this element in given region?
        if s <= (int(apple) + a) <= t:
            # then capture it
            count_Apple += 1
    for orange in oranges:
        if s <= (int(orange) + b) <= t:
            count_Oranges += 1
    print(count_Apple)
    print(count_Oranges)
    
 # List comprehensioan:
 # This code exactly does the same thing as we wrote above. But this one is more elegant :).
 def countApplesAndOranges(s, t, a, b, apples, oranges):
    print(len([apple for apple in apples if s <= (int(apple) + a) <= t]))
    print(len([orange for orange in oranges if s <= (int(orange) + b) <= t]))
